# About the project

I'm very excited to attend a university course after many years. I have finished my Ph.D about 4 years ago. So I'm doing this course because I want to learn and update my skills.

I'm working as a medical physicist at the local university hospital. I carry out also some research projects. In the future, I'm hoping to do more teaching in HU.
